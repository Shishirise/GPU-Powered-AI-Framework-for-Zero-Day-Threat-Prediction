## **Step 1 – Project Planning and Conceptualization**

###  What
This is the foundation stage where you define what your project is, why you’re doing it, and what you aim to achieve.  

###  Why
Proper planning gives your project a clear direction and helps you avoid confusion later. It allows you to identify required datasets, tools, and hardware resources early.  

###  How
1. Define your **project goal**: Build a GPU-accelerated AI system that detects unknown (zero-day) network attacks before they cause damage.  
2. Clarify your **research question**: “Can transformer-based deep learning models predict zero-day threats using anomaly detection on network traffic data?”  
3. List the **objectives**:
   - Build an end-to-end cybersecurity AI framework.
   - Use GPU acceleration for large-scale data processing.
   - Integrate explainable AI to make predictions transparent.
4. Set up a project folder structure (`data`, `src`, `models`, `dashboard`, `logs`).  
5. Plan the timeline (e.g., 2 weeks for dataset prep, 3 weeks for training, 1 week for dashboard/report).

Expected output: A written outline describing the project’s purpose, deliverables, and hardware/software plan.

## **Step 2 – Environment and Tool Setup**

###  What
This step prepares the technical environment where your AI system will run. It involves installing necessary software, libraries, and GPU toolkits.  

###  Why
Machine learning and GPU tools require precise configurations. Having a clean, dedicated environment ensures everything works without version conflicts.  

### How
1. **Install software:** Visual Studio Code (editor), Anaconda (Python environment manager), and Git (version control).  
2. **Create your Python environment:** Use Python 3.10 since most modern AI libraries support it.  
3. **Install required libraries:**  
   - **PyTorch** → core deep learning framework with GPU support.  
   - **RAPIDS cuDF / cuML** → GPU-accelerated data preprocessing tools.  
   - **Scikit-Learn** → evaluation metrics.  
   - **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn** → for data analysis and plotting.  
   - **SHAP / LIME** → for explainability analysis.  
   - **Streamlit** → for creating an interactive dashboard.  
4. **Verify GPU access:** Run a simple check (e.g., verify that CUDA detects the GPU).  
5. **Connect to TACC:** Log into the Texas Advanced Computing Center using SSH and confirm GPU queue access.  

Expected output: A working Python + GPU environment ready for AI training.

## **Step 3 – Dataset Selection and Acquisition**

###  What
Identify, download, and organize the dataset you’ll use for training and testing.  

###  Why
Your model’s success depends heavily on data quality. The dataset should contain realistic network traffic patterns with labeled attacks and benign behavior.  

###  How
1. **Primary options:**  
   - **CICIDS 2017** (University of New Brunswick) – widely used, contains 14 attack types and normal traffic.  
   - **UNSW-NB15** (University of New South Wales) – balanced dataset with modern attack categories.  
2. **Alternative datasets:** MAWILab, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, or Bot-IoT.  
3. **Download the dataset:** From official links or Kaggle mirrors.  
4. **Organize it:** Store the files in the `data/` folder inside your project directory.  
5. **Upload to TACC:** Transfer using `scp` for GPU-based operations.  

Expected output: A verified dataset folder ready for preprocessing.

---

## **Step 4 – Data Exploration and Understanding**

###  What
Examine the structure, size, and characteristics of your dataset before preprocessing it.  

###  Why
Understanding your data helps you identify missing values, feature distributions, and the balance between normal and attack samples.  

###  How
1. Open your dataset in Excel or a Python DataFrame.  
2. Identify key columns (source IP, destination IP, ports, packet sizes, flow duration, etc.).  
3. Note which columns represent numerical vs. categorical data.  
4. Check for imbalances — e.g., too many “normal” records vs. “attack” records.  
5. Visualize feature distributions using plots (histograms or bar charts).  

Expected output: A short report summarizing dataset structure and insights before cleaning.

---

## **Step 5 – Data Preprocessing**

###  What
Clean, encode, normalize, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.  

###  Why
AI models cannot process raw or mixed data. Preprocessing ensures the input is numeric, standardized, and suitable for training.  

###  How
1. **Clean the data:** Remove unnecessary identifiers (IPs, timestamps) and handle missing values.  
2. **Encode categorical variables:** Convert strings like “TCP” or “HTTP” into numeric codes.  
3. **Normalize numeric features:** Scale values so all features contribute equally to learning.  
4. **Shuffle the dataset:** Randomize order to prevent bias.  
5. **Split into training and testing data:** Use 80 % for training, 20 % for testing.  
6. **Save processed data:** Store as compressed files (CSV or Parquet) for reuse.  

Libraries used: RAPIDS cuDF (for GPU-based preprocessing), Pandas (for structure).  
Expected output: Cleaned, balanced, and ready-to-train dataset.

## **Step 6 – Model Design and Architecture**

###  What
Plan and conceptualize the deep learning architecture (Transformer Autoencoder).  

###  Why
The Transformer model can capture complex relationships in network traffic. The Autoencoder design allows it to learn normal traffic and identify anomalies (zero-day attacks).  

###  How
1. The **encoder** compresses input data into a compact representation (latent space).  
2. The **decoder** attempts to reconstruct the original input.  
3. The **reconstruction error** is used to detect anomalies — higher errors indicate abnormal traffic.  
4. You’ll use **PyTorch** to implement this architecture because it supports GPU operations seamlessly.  

Expected output: A clear architectural diagram or description for implementation.

---

## **Step 7 – GPU Training on TACC**

###  What
Train your AI model using TACC’s high-performance GPU clusters.  

###  Why
Training large datasets on GPUs drastically reduces runtime and allows deeper models to converge faster.  

###  How
1. **Upload project files** to your TACC directory.  
2. **Load environment modules** (Python, CUDA, PyTorch).  
3. **Submit your job script** using `sbatch` to the GPU queue.  
4. **Monitor progress:** Use `squeue` to check running jobs and view logs for training status.  
5. **Output:** After successful training, you’ll have a saved model file (e.g., `transformer_autoencoder.pt`).  

Expected output: A fully trained model stored under `models/`.

---

## **Step 8 – Threshold and Anomaly Detection**

###  What
Determine which predictions are normal or anomalous based on reconstruction error.  

###  Why
Autoencoders output continuous error values. You must define a threshold (e.g., 95th percentile of training error) to classify anomalies.  

###  How
1. Evaluate reconstruction errors on the training set.  
2. Choose a percentile-based cutoff (commonly 95 %).  
3. Apply the same threshold to test data to mark attacks vs. normal flows.  
4. Save results for evaluation.  

Expected output: A binary classification of normal vs. anomalous network behavior.

---

## **Step 9 – Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics**

###  What
Measure how effective your model is at identifying zero-day attacks.  

###  Why
Metrics validate whether the system is reliable and ready for deployment.  

###  How
1. Use **Scikit-Learn** metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
2. Analyze **Confusion Matrix** to see true vs. false detections.  
3. Plot **ROC curves** for visual performance comparison.  
4. Compare GPU vs. CPU training times for efficiency analysis.  

Expected output: A complete performance report with metric tables and graphs.

---

## **Step 10 – Explainability (XAI) Integration**

###  What
Use Explainable AI to interpret model predictions.  

###  Why
Transparency is essential in cybersecurity. Understanding which features led to anomaly detection builds trust and improves analysis.  

###  How
1. Use SHAP or LIME to interpret model outputs.  
2. Visualize which features (e.g., packet length, flow duration) contributed most to anomaly scores.  
3. Include these visuals in your final report and dashboard.  

Expected output: Explainability graphs and insights highlighting important features.

---

## **Step 11 – Dashboard Development and Visualization**

###  What
Develop an interactive dashboard for monitoring and presenting detection results.  

###  Why
A visual interface makes it easier to demonstrate system output and track anomalies.  

###  How
1. Use Streamlit (a simple Python web framework).  
2. Display number of samples, detected anomalies, and performance charts.  
3. Show top influential features from SHAP.  
4. Deploy locally for demonstration.  

Expected output: A functional dashboard displaying model results.

---

## **Step 12 – Documentation and Reporting**

###  What
Prepare your report summarizing the full workflow, findings, and results.  

###  Why
Documentation communicates your methodology and proves academic or professional integrity.  

###  How
1. Write sections: Abstract, Objective, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.  
2. Include screenshots of dashboard, plots, and TACC job outputs.  
3. Summarize key metrics (accuracy, F1-score, runtime).  
4. Discuss future improvements (real-time detection, larger datasets).  

Expected output: A professional final report and presentation slides.

---

## **Step 13 – Project Archiving and Future Expansion**

###  What
Backup all work and plan future enhancements.  

###  Why
Archiving ensures reproducibility, and future updates (like real-time traffic streaming) can extend your project’s impact.  

###  How
1. Store final files (`models/`, `data/`, `dashboard/`, `RESULTS.md`).  
2. Push to GitHub (private repo) or compress as a zip file.  
3. Save a `README.md` describing your setup and usage steps.  
4. Identify possible extensions (e.g., using federated learning or multi-node GPUs).  

Expected output: A complete, reusable research project.
