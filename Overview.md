The GPU-Powered AI Framework for Zero-Day Threat Prediction is a cutting-edge cybersecurity project that
combines artificial intelligence and high-performance GPU computing to detect emerging cyber threats before
 they are publicly known. Traditional intrusion detection systems rely on static rules or known signatures,
which fail to recognize zero-day attacks that exploit new vulnerabilities. This project addresses that
limitation by building an adaptive deep learning system capable of identifying suspicious and previously
unseen behaviors within massive volumes of network traffic data. By leveraging GPU acceleration through
the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), the system can train and infer on millions of data packets
at lightning speed, learning complex temporal and spatial relationships in traffic flows that often
indicate early stages of an attack. The goal is to transform cybersecurity defense from reactive
detection to proactive prediction, reducing the time gap between threat emergence and mitigation.

At the core of the framework is a Transformer-based neural architecture—a model type known for its
ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships in sequential data. Using datasets
such as CICIDS2017 or UNSW-NB15, the system preprocesses raw traffic data using GPU-optimized libraries
like RAPIDS cuDF, which drastically reduces computation time during feature extraction and encoding.
The Transformer model functions as an autoencoder, learning normal network behavior patterns and assigning
 higher anomaly scores to flows that deviate from the learned baseline. Training and fine-tuning occur
 on TACC’s GPU nodes using PyTorch and cuDNN, ensuring high throughput and reduced latency.
The project also integrates explainable AI tools such as SHAP or Grad-CAM to visualize which packet
features contribute most to the anomaly detection process—helping cybersecurity analysts understand and trust the model’s predictions.

Beyond detection, the project delivers a complete deployment pipeline and visualization interface. After model training,
inference is served through TorchServe or NVIDIA Triton, allowing real-time traffic monitoring.
A Streamlit dashboard provides interactive visualization of network anomalies, packet-level analysis,
 and key performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and latency comparisons between CPU and GPU performance.
This holistic approach ensures that the framework is not only scientifically rigorous but also practically
deployable in enterprise, government, and research network environments. Ultimately, this project positions
 GPU-powered AI as a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity defense—offering an adaptive, explainable,
 and scalable solution to the ever-evolving challenge of zero-day cyber threats.
